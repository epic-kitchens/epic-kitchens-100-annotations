## Dataset Details
The EPIC-Kitchens-100 dataset is an extension of the EPIC-Kitchens-55 dataset. Videos are distinguished as follows:

* `PXX_YY.MP4` videos originate from EPIC-Kitchens-55.
* `PXX_1YY.MP4` videos originate from the extension collected for EPIC-Kitchens-100 (thus represent new videos).



The dataset currently has 6 active benchmarks:

* Action Recognition
* Weakly Supervised Action Recognition
* Action Detection
* Action Anticipation
* Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
* Action Retrieval

We provide csv files for the train/val/test sets of each benchmark detailed below for ease of use.

Ground truth is provided for action segments as action/verb/noun labels along with the start and end times of the segment.


## Quick Start

Here you can download the annotation files for all of the challenges. For more information on each challenge, please see the paper [here]().

## Additional Information

### File Downloads

Due to the size of the dataset we provide scripts for downloading parts of the dataset:

* [videos]() (GB)
* [frames]() (GB)
  * [rgb-frames]() (GB)
  * [flow-frames]() (GB)

*Note: These scripts will work for Linux and Mac. For Windows users a bash 
installation should work.*

These scripts replicate the folder structure of the dataset release on RDSF, found 
[here]().

### Differences to EPIC-Kitchen-100

Whilst videos from EPIC-Kitchens-55 are used within EPIC-Kitchens-100 some of the annotations have been modified to improve the quality of the annotations. Additionally, with EPIC-Kitchens-100, the verb/noun classes have been updated to cover the annotations from the new videos. Because of this, the annotations from EPIC-Kitchens-55 cannot be used for EPIC-Kitchens-100.
