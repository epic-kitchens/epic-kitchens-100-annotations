## Dataset Details
The EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset is an extension of the EPIC-KITCHENS-55 dataset. Videos are distinguished as follows:

* `PXX_YY.MP4` videos originate from EPIC-KITCHENS-55.
* `PXX_1YY.MP4` videos originate from the extension collected for EPIC-KITCHENS-100 (thus represent new videos).



The dataset currently has 6 active benchmarks:

* [Action Recognition](#action-recognition-challenge)
* [Weakly Supervised Action Recognition](#weakly-supervised-action-recognition-challenge)
* [Action Detection](#action-detection-challenge)
* [Action Anticipation](#action-anticipation-challenge)
* [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](#unsupervised-domain-adaptation-challenge)
* [Action Retrieval](#action-retrieval-challenge)

We provide csv files for the train/val/test sets of each benchmark detailed below for ease of use, see [Important Files](#important-files) for more information.

Ground truth is provided for action segments as action/verb/noun labels along with the start and end times of the segment.

We also provide automatic annotations in the form of object masks and hand/object BBoxes. See [automatic annotations](#automatic-annotations-download) for more details.

## Quick Start

Here you can download the annotation files for all of the challenges. For more information on each challenge, please see the paper [here]().
A download script is provided for the videos, RGB Frames and Flow frames [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100).

### Action Recognition Challenge
1. Download the videos/RGB/Flow frames [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100) with the following command: 

```bash
python epic_downloader.py --videos --rgb-frames --flow-frames
```

2. Download the Action Recognition [train](EPIC_100_train.csv)/[val](EPIC_100_validation.csv)/[test](EPIC_100_test_timestamps.csv) files.
3. Enjoy the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset in your favourite action recognition model, see [the paper](#citing) for details on the models we used for this baseline. Models trained on EPIC-KITCHENS-55 can be found [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/action-models) as a starting point.

### Weakly Supervised Action Recognition Challenge
1. Download the videos/RGB/Flow frames [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100) with the following command: 

```bash
python epic_downloader.py --videos --rgb-frames --flow-frames
```

2. This challenge uses the Action Recognition files, download the [train](EPIC_100_train.csv)/[val](EPIC_100_validation.csv)/[test](EPIC_100_test_timestamps.csv) files.
3. The weakly supervised challenge uses the narration timestamp, not the the start/end times of the action. Therefore a simple baseline would be to modify an action recognition model to use the surrounding 5s worth of frames. See [the paper](#citing) for details on the models we used for this baseline.

### Action Detection Challenge
1. Download the videos/RGB/Flow frames [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100) with the following command: 

```bash
python epic_downloader.py --videos --rgb-frames --flow-frames
```

2. This challenge uses the Action Recognition files, download the [train](EPIC_100_train.csv)/[val](EPIC_100_validation.csv)/[test](EPIC_100_test_timestamps.csv) files.
3. Train an action proposal network on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 train set, for example [this model](https://github.com/JJBOY/BMN-Boundary-Matching-Network). This model predicts action-agnostic segments which still need to be classified.
4. Use your favourite action recognition model to classify the proposals ([example models](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/action-models)).

### Action Anticipation Challenge
1. Download the videos/RGB/Flow frames [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100) with the following command: 

```bash
python epic_downloader.py --videos --rgb-frames --flow-frames
```

2. This challenge uses the Action Recognition files, download the [train](EPIC_100_train.csv)/[val](EPIC_100_validation.csv)/[test](EPIC_100_test_timestamps.csv) files.
3. A simple baseline for this task is to train an action recognition model (example models [here]()) on the 5 seconds that precede an action with a 1 second gap. For example, an action that starts at 20.00s in a video would see frames between 14.00s and 19.00s.

### Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Challenge
The unsupervised domain adaptation challenge tests how models can cope with similar data collected 2 years later on the task of action recognition.

1. Download the videos/RGB/Flow frames [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100) with the following command: 

```bash
python epic_downloader.py --videos --rgb-frames --flow-frames --domain-adaptation
```

2. Download the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation [source train](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_source_train.csv)/[target train](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_train_timestamps.csv)/[source_test](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_source_test_timestamps.csv)/[target test](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_test_timestamps.csv)/[source val](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_source_val.csv)/[target val](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_val.csv) files.
3. Extract video features (for all six splits) using an off-the-shelf model trained on **EPIC-KITCHENS-55** ([example model](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/action-models)).
4. A simple baseline is using a domain discriminator (prediciting whether a video came from the source, EPIC-KITCHENS-55, or the target, EPIC-KITCHENS-100) to align the two domains. See [the paper](#citing) for details on the models we used for this baseline.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON HYPER-PARAMETER TUNING. As the target domain is unlabelled, the training splits cannot be used for hyper-parameter tuning. You must use the validation splits to choose hyper-parameters. The procedure for hyper-parameter tuning and training is as follows:

1. Train your model on [source val](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_source_val.csv) with unlabelled data from [target val](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_val.csv).
2. Evaluate your model on [target val](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_val.csv) using the labels provided (these labels should not be used during training).
3. Select hyper-parameters based on the performance on [target val](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_val.csv).
4. Re-train your model on [source train](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_source_train.csv)/[target train](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_train_timestamps.csv) with selected hyper-parameters.
5. Evaluate the re-trained model on [target test](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_target_test_timestamps.csv) to produce action predictions for the challenge leaderboard.

It is optional but highly ecouraged to evalute the performance on [source_test](UDA_annotations/EPIC_100_uda_source_test_timestamps.csv) to compare source domain performances.

### Action Retrieval Challenge
1. Download the videos/RGB/Flow frames [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100) with the following command: 

```bash
python epic_downloader.py --videos --rgb-frames --flow-frames --action-retrieval
```
2. Download the Action Retrieval [train](retrieval_annotations/EPIC_100_retrieval_train.csv)/[test](retrieval_annotations/EPIC_100_retrieval_test.csv) files.
3. Extract video features (for both the train and test set) using an off-the-shelf model trained on **EPIC-KITCHENS-55** ([example model](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/action-models)).
4. Extract word2vec features for the captions from both the train and test set ([example models](https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors)).
5. Enjoy the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset in your favourite video retrieval model, see [the paper](#citing) for details on the models we used for this baseline.

## Additional Information

### File Downloads

Due to the size of the dataset we provide a script for downloading parts of the dataset which can be found [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100).
If you wish to download the extension only (i.e. you have already downloaded EPIC-KITCHENS-55) the following command can be run:
```bash
python epic_downloader.py --extension-only
```

If you wish to download the whole dataset, the following command can be run:
```bash
python epic_downloader.py
```

See the [README](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

#### Automatic Annotations Download

We also provide automatic annotations in the form of object masks extracted through the use of MaskRCNN and hand-object BBoxes from [ddshan/Hand_Object_Detector](https://github.com/ddshan/Hand_Object_Detector)
([CVPR
2020](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Shan_Understanding_Human_Hands_in_Contact_at_Internet_Scale_CVPR_2020_paper.html)).

The masks can be downloaded from [data.bris](https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/3l8eci2oqgst92n14w2yqi5ytu) and a supporting library is available from [this repo](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-100-object-masks).

The hand-object bboxes can be downloaded from [data.bris](https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/3l8eci2oqgst92n14w2yqi5ytu) and a supporting library is available from [this repo](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-100-hand-object-bboxes).

### Differences to EPIC-Kitchen-55

#### Updated Annotations

Whilst videos from EPIC-KITCHENS-55 are used within EPIC-KITCHENS-100 some of the annotations have been modified to improve the quality of the annotations. Additionally, with EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the verb/noun classes have been updated to cover the annotations from the new videos. Because of this, the annotations from EPIC-KITCHENS-55 cannot be used for EPIC-KITCHENS-100.


#### Missing Narration Timestamps

Due to the differences in the annotation pipeline between EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EPIC-KITCHENS-55, it was impossible to assign the narration timestamp to every action. Because of this, there are actions within [EPIC_100_train.csv](#epic_100_traincsv) and [EPIC_100_validation.csv](#epic_100_validationcsv) which do not have timestamp narrations and are thus marked with NaN within the dataframes.

### Pickle Files

We also provide pickle files for all of the main train/val/test csvs for ease of use. These files require python 3.5+ and pandas 1.0.0+ to read.
The pickle files are automatically tagged with the commit hash and version for version control purposes which can be found in python using the following commands:

```
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> train = pd.read_pickle('EPIC_100_train.pkl')
>>> train._metadata
{'commit_hash': 'ce7a0fb', 'version_number': '1.0.0'
```

showing that this version of the `EPIC_100_train.pkl` came from commit hash ce7a0fb and version number 1.0.0.
